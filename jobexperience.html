				<h3>Madison Engineering Leadership Development Fellow | James Madison University | August 2020 - Janurary 2021</h3>
				
				<p>In the James Madison University Engineering Department, there is a leadership opportunity that consists of mentoring a group of first-year engineering 
				students as a junior or senior within the program. This allows them to have adjustment help to their new collegiate experience and help them find their path 
				within or outside of engineering. This opportunity consists of learning, applying, and teaching leadership theory and practice to our peers and "Framilies" of first year 
				students. We use the term "Framily" to describe the groups first friends within engineering as well as a family like dynamic they share throughout their time in the program. 
				I benefited a lot from this program within my own personal journey as well as my professional journey. </p>

				<h3>Head of Product & Co-Founder | VINETEQ | November 2018 - Feburary 2020</h3>
				<p>I started VINETEQ during my Sophomore year of college with two entrepreneurial friends of mine.
				VINETEQ is a SaaS business where we aid vineyard owners in the agricultural spray decision making process
				by utitilizing temperature, weather, humidity, and growth stage data. We were able to accurately choose pesticides, fungicides, and 
				insecticides for use on the farmer's vines. We then picked up outside investment from a development shop, 923 Digital, to aid us in a 
				product level development and rollout. I decided to leave the company due to differing level of passion for the project from my partners. I 
				remain to be close friends and open to future work with the team.</p>

				<h3>Research Assistant | James Madison Univerity | May 2019 - March 2020</h3>
				
				<p>I was a Research Assistant with Dr. Shraddha Joshi in the James Madison University Eningeering Department.
				The main focus of our research is a basis around Internet of Things technologies. 
				During the Summer of 2019, I worked with her in hopes to develope an IoT enabled 
				design studio that would aid students along the way with both light-color and sound 
				manipulation. We have since pivotted due to the high amount of outside professional
				help to further develop the prototype. We are now looking into many fields of interest where
				there is the opportunity of IoT solutions in hopes to patent our idea. My employment came to a close due to funding issues 
				associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>
				<p>My responsibilities include:</p>
				<ul>
				
					<li><p>Python developement based around hardware systems.</p></li>
					<li><p>Algorithm Design</p></li>
					<li><p>Circuit Design</p></li>
					<li><p>Concept Generation</p></li>
					<li><p>Opportunity Research</p></li>
					<li><p>Stakeholder Research &  Discovery</p></li>
