					a perspective memmber must first apply and recieve partake in an interview with all current members.

					<h3>Engineering Ambassadors | Lead of the In-Reach Committee | April 2018 - May 2020</h3>
				
					<p>Engineering Ambassadors, or EA for short, is an organization with the goal to change the 
					conversation about engineering from your math and science based stereotype to the 
					truthful abundance of creativity. As the Lead of the In-Reach Committee, my main
					responsibilities consist of planning and executing events for visitors. This includes
					events as small as a family coming to visit the department and as large as 50+ middle 
					school students coming to JMU to participate in an engineering based activity.</p>
